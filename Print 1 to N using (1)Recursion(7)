Question 7 :Given an integer n, write a function to print all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using recursion.

You must not use any loops such as for, while, or do-while.
The function should print each number on a separate line, in increasing order from 1 to n.

Examples:
Input: n = 5

Output:

1  

2  

3  

4  

5

Input: n = 1

Output:

1

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100


Solution:
class Solution {
    public void printNumbers(int n) {
        //base case
        if(n==0){
          return;
        }
        printNumbers(n-1);
        System.out.println(n+"");
    }
}
