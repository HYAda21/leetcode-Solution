Question 8: Given an integer n, write a function to print all numbers from n to 1 (inclusive) using recursion.

You must not use any loops such as for, while, or do-while.
The function should print each number on a separate line, in decreasing order from n to 1

Examples:
Input: 5

Output:

5

4

3

2

1

Input: 1

Output:

1

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100

Solution:
class Solution {
    public void printNumbers(int n) {
        // base case
        if(n==0){
          return;
        }
        System.out.println(n);
        printNumbers(n-1);
    }
}
