Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.



The upper bound of x is defined as the smallest index i such that nums[i] > x.



If no such index is found, return the size of the array.


Examples:
Input : n= 4, nums = [1,2,2,3], x = 2

Output:3

Explanation:

Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

Input : n = 5, nums = [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9

Output: 3

Explanation:

Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

Solution :
class Solution {
    public int upperBound(int[] nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(nums[i]>x){
                return i;
            }
        }
    return n;
    }
}
